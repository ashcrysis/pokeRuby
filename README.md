# README

This is an study website that fetchs POKEAPI https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2 for pokemon info, whilst getting user input in order to search for pokemon id or pokemon name.
I am using Ruby On Rails, so in order to test anything you need to have Ruby 3.1.4 installed, and run bundle install on the pokeRuby directory, after everything is installed, run rails s on the terminal (need to be in pokeRuby dir)
